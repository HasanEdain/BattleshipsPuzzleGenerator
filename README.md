## About
This is an OSX application that can generate printable PDF puzzle sheets and solution sheets for "Battleship" puzzles.

## Puzzle
A rectangular grid, along the X and Y axis there are numbers for each column and row. These numbers indicate the number of ships in that column or row.
Ships can be horizontal or vertical, but NOT diagonal.
Ships can be one or more squares long.

Solve the puzzle by making the counts for all rows and columns be the same as the hints.

## Using
I run out of XCode still because I have not done the directory work to save in convenient locations.

the files save in: 
/Users/<CurrentUser>/Library/Containers/<bundleIdentifier>/Data/<filename>_<saveCount>_puzzle.pdf
/Users/<CurrentUser>/Library/Containers/<bundleIdentifier>/Data/<filename>_<saveCount>_solved.pdf
/Users/<CurrentUser>/Library/Containers/<bundleIdentifier>/Data/<filename>_<saveCount>_puzzle.txt
